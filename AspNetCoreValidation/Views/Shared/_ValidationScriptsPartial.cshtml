    @*The jQuery Unobtrusive Validation script is a custom Microsoft front-end library that builds on the popular jQuery Validate plugin.
    Without jQuery Unobtrusive Validation, you would have to code the same validation logic in two places: 
    once in the server side validation attributes on model properties, 
    and then again in client side scripts (the examples for jQuery Validate's validate() method shows how complex this could become)*@
